# FilePartitioner

This is the corresponding GUI application for my [File-Partition-Parser](https://github.com/jonaspfl/file-partition-parser), designed to simplify the user experience with an intuitive interface.

It mainly adds GUI functionality to make the usage of the parser much easier and enabling better workflow.

Additionally, this also adds built in MD5 hash functionality, that can be used to confirm the correct reassembling of the given data files to their original form.

Note, that this application can't work without the parser, mentioned above.
